# ChatUI v2 (0.2.0)
ChatUI offers you the option to display the Twitch chat via Beat Saber.
There are a few tutorials here on how to use ChatUI correctly and how to get the best streaming experience on Quest.

## Installation
Install the mod via MBF or download it directly on GitHub on the release page.

## Setup your twitch connection to read the chat
Once you have installed the mod, start Beat Saber. Then go to the Meta Quest browser and enter http://localhost:4444/. 
This will take you to the ChatUI website. Find the Channel Name field and enter your Twitch channel there and then you're done!

## Setup the twitch bot
In order to use the Twitch bot you must have already entered your channel name. You go to the ChatUI website and press the Get a new Token button. 
Then you log in either with your main channel or with any account that you want to use as the bot. 
Once you have logged in you will see a special code, **which you should definitely not share!**
Copy this and enter it on the ChatUI website and then press Save. The Twitch bot is now set up.

## How do I stream lag-free and smooth on Quest

First of all, Meta has the website where you can see your stream directly on the website. However, it is not the best as it can usually lead to audio problems, graphics problems or still images. Recommended that you get the [Meta Quest Developer Hub](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-developer-hub-win/). This is an app from Meta with a special streaming option. The only thing that is required is that you are connected to the PC with the cable at all times and that you have [Developer Mode](https://bsmg.wiki/quest-modding.html#developer-mode) switched on. Once you have [downloaded the program from Meta's website](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-developer-hub-win/), connect to the Quest via the PC with a cable. Then the app will initially give you a lot of options, all you need is streaming. Press the Cast button and then a new window will open where your entire quest will be streamed. If you look up there are a few ways you can change the image, select the Cinematic option. All open apps will then be closed and you will see a good stream on your PC. First, enable the audio option at the top if it is disabled. First, open Beat Saber and then you're ready to go!

**Please be sure that the microphone is not being streamed on the MQDH App!**

## API Usage

There is a built-in API so you can interact with the mod. The API runs on the port `4444`.

Here are some examples what you could do with the API in Python.
